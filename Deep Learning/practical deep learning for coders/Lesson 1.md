# practice deep learning for coder 

- where have we got to now with deep learning
	- deep learning and art together 
	- google ai
- why are we able to create deep learning (like bird recognizer), and why we couldn't do it before?
	- In 2012, standford make project, it use for find breast cancle patients
		- give it features to ask learning 
		- => it's classic machine learning approach
	- In 2015, trained neural network
		- **we don't give it features, ask it to learn features **
		=> neural network do it automatically
		- we don't have to hand code the feature -> they can be learned 
- deep learning using pytorch
	- less code is better
	- fast.ai has been a really popular library, widely use in this industry
